            <h3>Planning and Designing Urban Agriculture Systems</h3>
            
            <p>
                Urban agriculture systems must be carefully planned and designed to maximize the use of
                available resources, ensure sustainability, and adapt to urban constraints. This module provides a
                detailed guide to site assessment, system designs, and resource management.
            </p>
            <h5>1. Site Assessment and Selection</h5>
            <p>
                Selecting a suitable site is crucial for the success of an urban agriculture project. Factors such as
                space, sunlight, water availability, and soil condition must be considered.
            </p>
            <h5> Considerations:  </h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Space Availability: </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Urban agriculture often takes place in unconventional spaces. Potential areas
                        include rooftops, balconies, vacant lots, community parks, and even walls
                    </li>
                    <li>Conduct a survey of available spaces and evaluate their potential for agricultural
                        use, including accessibility and structural integrity (for rooftops).
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li>Sunlight Exposure: </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Most vegetable crops require 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily.
                    </li>
                    <li>Conduct a light assessment to identify areas receiving adequate sunlight, and
                        consider planting shade-tolerant crops or using reflective materials to enhance
                        light availability in shaded spaces.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li>Water Source: </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Ensure access to a reliable and clean water source. Options include municipal
                        water lines, rainwater harvesting, or nearby water bodies.
                    </li>
                    <li>Water quality is critical for food safety, especially if plants are consumed fresh or
                        grown hydroponically.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li>Soil Condition: </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        In urban settings where soil may be limited or contaminated, use soilless growing
                        techniques like hydroponics or container gardening.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        For areas with soil, test for contaminants like heavy metals and adjust pH, nutrient
                        levels, and organic matter as needed.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h5>2. System Designs</h5>
